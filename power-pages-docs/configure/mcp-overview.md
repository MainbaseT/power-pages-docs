# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Power Pages overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Power Pages lets AI agents and copilots securely interact with Power Pages data through a standardized interface. This capability lets organizations extend their Power Pages sites into AI-native experiences while maintaining full control over security and permissions.

## What is MCP Server for Power Pages?

MCP Server for Power Pages is a feature that exposes Power Pages data, APIs, and business logic through an MCP-compliant interface. It lets Large Language Models (LLMs) like Microsoft 365 Copilot perform secure CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Dataverse data while respecting web roles, table permissions, and authentication boundaries.

As organizations increasingly use AI agents to interact with business data, the need for secure, standardized interfaces between AI systems and enterprise applications grows. The Model Context Protocol provides this standardization, letting AI assistants query and manipulate Power Pages data conversationally through any MCP-compatible AI client.

## Key capabilities

With MCP Server for Power Pages, makers can:

- **Expose Power Pages resources**: Makes data, APIs, and business logic available through an MCP-compliant interface.
- **Enable secure CRUD operations**: Allows AI agents to create, read, update, and delete Dataverse records.
- **Maintain security controls**: Keeps full control through web roles, table permissions, and authentication boundaries.
- **Extend to AI experiences**: Enables Power Pages sites to be consumed from Microsoft 365 Copilot.
- **Support internal workflows**: Empowers internal teams to perform portal operations without navigating the portal UI.
